Learning Management System by spjumde @MITAOE
Problem / Project / Opportunity
With the increase in the number of students, better management of learning system
is required. The web-based learning management system focuses on improving the
management of learning in a school, college or universities. What if Instructor will
be able to monitor progress of each learner and Learner will be able to keep track
of their own progress or what if instead of writing report for each learner on paper
the report is generated automatically? or Instructor and learner can manage work
from phone sitting at home just by single click!
This provided the opportunity to create a web-based learning management system
with which Admin will be able to Approve Instructor & Learner View, Edit or
Delete Instructor & Learner, Courses, Tests, Generate Various Reports.
Give Instructor the ease of managing course, tests, learners list and progress and
Students will be able to Learn Course, appear for Test, view Score and Ranking,
give Feedback on course and System through phone.


Knowledge acquired
While making the website, I learnt about various programming languages which
are used for website development such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, Bootstrap, etc. I
understood what is meant by front end and backend of website and how they are
different form each other.
I learnt steps that are used for creating the website from scratch. For
accomplishing the project goal going step by step helps to make website fulfill the
customer demands. I also used different apps which are used for making things
easier in making website such as Balsamiq for making website template.

Skills learned
I learnt how to write the code for front-end and back-end using languages like
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and how to use localhost server such as Xamp.
Learnt how to develop the SRS for the project and use Balsamiq to make the
template before making the actual website. Also learnt how to make the user
manual for different users.
I also learnt how to work in a team and how to read, update and debug code of
others.

Observed attitudes and gained values
I found that it is Important to follow the steps for accomplishing a project goal. The
needs of the customer have to be converted into technical terms and functions,
which should be the base of the project.
Website development give us the freedom to use our imagination to create a
webpage, how it will look and how it will be more comfortable for users to use.
It is important to discuss with others while working in group and hear what they
want to say. Distributing work among the group need leadership qualities.
Importance of Comments is realized while working with others.

The most challenging task performed
While working in group to hear and accept others opinions is quite difficult task
and to distribute code to different co-worker is also difficult task.
Reading and updating others code is difficult task and is very difficult to
understand if there are no comments in the code.
